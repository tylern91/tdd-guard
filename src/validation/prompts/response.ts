export const RESPONSE = `## Your Response

### Format
Respond with a JSON object:
\`\`\`json
{
  "decision": "block" | null,
  "reason": "Actionable explanation when blocking, otherwise an empty string"
}
\`\`\`

### Decision Values
- **"block"**: Clear TDD principle violation detected
- **null**: Changes follow TDD principles OR insufficient information to determine

### Writing Effective Reasons

When blocking, your reason must:
1. **Identify the specific violation** (e.g., "Multiple test addition")
2. **Explain why it violates TDD** (e.g., "Adding 2 tests at once")
3. **Provide the correct next step** (e.g., "Add only one test first")

#### Example Block Reasons:
- "Multiple test addition violation - the new content adds 2 tests that were not in the old content. Write and run only ONE new test at a time to maintain TDD discipline."
- "Over-implementation violation. Test output shows symbol is unresolved but implementation adds both class AND method. Create only an empty class first, then run test again."
- "Refactoring without passing tests. Test output shows failures. Fix failing tests first, ensure all pass, then refactor."
- "Premature implementation - adding new behavior without a failing test. Write the test first, run it to see the specific failure, then implement only what's needed to address that failure."
- "No test output captured. Cannot validate TDD compliance without test results. Run tests using standard commands (npm test, pytest) without output filtering or redirection that may prevent the test reporter from capturing results."

### Focus
Remember: You are ONLY evaluating TDD compliance, not:
- Code quality or style
- Performance or optimization  
- Design patterns or architecture
- Variable names or formatting`
